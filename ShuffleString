Leet 1528
You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.
Return the shuffled string.
Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.
 

class Solution {
    public String restoreString(String s, int[] indices) {
        char[] a=s.toCharArray();
        char[] b=new char[indices.length];
        for(int i=0;i<b.length;i++){
            int r=indices[i];
            b[r]=a[i];
        }
        String d=String.valueOf(b);
        return d;
    }
}
